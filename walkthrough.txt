The Psion

In my game the player is a telepath who is held prisoner in some facility and needs to use his/her powers to escape. 
Guards will follow the player and try to prevent him/her from escaping.
See help command in the game for a lot of information.



Walkthrough description. How the game *should* be played:

The player wakes up in a room.
First the player should go look around in the room, most importantly pick up the 'spellbook' from the desk.
Examining the desk will add the 'notebook' and 'pen' which can show a map of the in game world and add guards that the player knows.
Examining the other things may give hints about what the player can do.
At the door, the player can use the spell 'aurasight' to learn the name of the guard outside.
After this the player can use demoralize on him. (Command 'spellbook demoralize' describes in game how the spell can be used.)
If the player tries the spell 'compel', it can serve as an method of unlocking the door. Otherwise the lock can be picked with a hairpin found in the bed.

Once the door is unlocked, the player can go south and will find themselves in a hallway.
In the hallways and stairways there can be guards. Guards will follow the player character and prevent them from resting etc.
Guards can be dealt with in multiple ways including running away or using different spells.
Using 'aurasight' and 'demoralize' (or once learned, 'invisibility',) before entering the area a guard is in it is possible to get around remaining undetected. 

When guards are demoralized they become "items" and when examined they can drop items that the player can pick up.
After recieving the guard item 'key', the player can examine rooms in the hallways and pick up other random items.

An item named 'card' drops the 3rd time a guard is examined. This item opens the door on the first floor in the  west hallway.
The player then learns the 4 digit code to get out. The code will drop in item 'memo' from any of the guards in the room, or can be learned using spell 'mindsight'.

This teleports the player back to the original cell (and provides a fun little description). See notes below command walkthrough for more information about different outcomes.



Fast Walkthrough by commands: 

go east
take spellbook
go west
examine bed
take hairpin
go south
use hairpin
go south
run east
go east
aurasight

go west
demoralize Stan

use 7783
go south
go anywhere

This teleports the player back to the starting cell... (HOWEVER: Inventory and spells and even demroalized guards will be just as they were before the teleport.)



To "actually" win the payer must do one of these (or both):

Option 1: Collect items ('sheets', 'bottle' and 'fuel') from the rooms (obtain a 'key' from a demoralized guard and then 'examine doors') 
          and take a 'lighter' from a demoralized guard and assemble a bomb. Then the bomb must be used ('use bomb' or 'use lighter') 
          in the staff breakroom at the end. 
	      Instructions for this can be found in game in an item named 'journal' that also drops from the rooms.

Option 2: Cast aurasight once outside, after exiting the staff breakroom and then demoralize the boss, Gwen.
	      Hints that this is possible can be found in game in a couple items named 'diary' (very vague) and 'paper' that both drop from the rooms.

PS. 'mindsight Gwen' explains a bit of what the point of the story of the game is.


FUN STUFF:
I added a lot of fun items and descriptions for no particular reason but to make the game entertaining and in a way to add a degree of realism too.
It is probably not possible to play my game only once and figure out everything about it. I tried to cover *most* of the things that are possible in my game here in this walkthrough.
